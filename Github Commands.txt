where is the folder for the project?

Let me show you the quick command way.
I have never used the gui
ok sawa

Let me list the commands here:
git init - we have skipped this since it it already initialized
git remote add origin  <repo url>

Now you will be using only the below commands for subsequent uploads for this project. If starting on a new folder/project you start from step 2 ---sawa
git add .
git  commit -m <your custom message here>
git push origin master


the above commands are the main  one

so now kindly open the github account you created

now hope you have your email and password for your github account
yes

proceed
can I copy the password?

yes - but first input user name

got to your progfile

so your code is now updated to share you use the Link:  https://github.com/nokello2002/Python-Class.git


so now I continue with second class then I upload using the same processes starting at Git add .?
yes
sawa. So many thanks. Let me do it right away so i practice before I forget.
Sawasawa
