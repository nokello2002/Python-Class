Power Company Billing System

Description: 
This project is intended to demonstrate how a power utility company would determine monthly charges for the customers given their units of consumption and location of the premise where power is consumed.

Installation:
In case you need to have a full end-to-end experience with the system, you will require to install MySQL in your computer environment. 
Otherwise if you donâ€™t want to use MySQL then you will have to connect every section of the code that references MySQL.

For the text file, please change the location of the file to point to your own computer environment.

How to Use This Project:
Once you have the environment set, you just run the program. It will display the menus on the screen. 
To add a New Customer press 1. On the New Customer screen, you will be prompted for customer number, which must be non-floating number, and then you add other details including names, contact and zone of the premise using the power. Save. The details will be saved in both text file and MySQL.
